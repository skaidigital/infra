# Infrastructure Automation Ideas

Building on the existing Sanity to R2 backup system, here are additional infrastructure automation opportunities that could leverage the same tech stack (Bun, TypeScript, GitHub Actions).

## Data Pipeline & Sync Operations

### Database Replication Workflows
- Automated PostgreSQL/MySQL backups to S3/R2 with point-in-time recovery
- Scheduled snapshots with configurable retention policies
- Automated restore testing to verify backup integrity

### Cross-Platform Data Sync
- Sync data between services (Stripe → Database, Analytics → Warehouse)
- ETL pipelines for business intelligence
- Real-time event streaming between systems

### CDN Cache Management
- Scheduled or triggered cache invalidation for Cloudflare/Fastly
- Smart cache warming after deployments
- Cache hit ratio monitoring and optimization

### Asset Optimization Pipeline
- Auto-compress and convert images/videos uploaded to storage
- Generate responsive image variants
- WebP/AVIF conversion for modern browsers

## Monitoring & Observability

### Synthetic Monitoring
- Automated API/website health checks with alerting
- User journey testing with Playwright
- Performance regression detection

### Log Aggregation Pipeline
- Ship logs from multiple services to centralized storage
- Log parsing and structured data extraction
- Alert on error patterns or anomalies

### Cost Monitoring
- Track cloud spending across AWS/GCP/Cloudflare with budget alerts
- Resource utilization reporting
- Cost allocation by project/team

### SSL Certificate Monitoring
- Track expiration dates and auto-renewal status
- Certificate transparency log monitoring
- TLS configuration compliance checking

## Security & Compliance

### Secret Rotation Automation
- Periodic rotation of API keys/tokens with zero downtime
- Vault integration for secret management
- Automated credential distribution

### Dependency Vulnerability Scanning
- Automated security updates for npm/Docker dependencies
- License compliance checking
- Supply chain security monitoring

### GDPR Data Workflows
- Automated user data removal across multiple systems
- Data portability export generation
- Consent management synchronization

### Audit Log Collection
- Centralize audit trails from various services
- Immutable log storage for compliance
- Automated compliance report generation

## Development Workflows

### Environment Provisioning
- Spin up preview environments for PRs with seeded data
- Automated teardown of unused environments
- Environment drift detection

### Database Migration Runner
- Automated migration execution across environments
- Rollback capabilities with snapshot restoration
- Schema change impact analysis

### Feature Flag Management
- Sync feature flags between LaunchDarkly/Unleash and codebase
- Automated flag cleanup for shipped features
- A/B test result collection

### API Documentation
- Auto-generate OpenAPI specs from code
- Postman collection generation
- API change detection and versioning

## Content & Media

### Static Site Rebuilds
- Trigger builds when CMS content changes
- Incremental build optimization
- Preview URL generation for content editors

### Media Processing
- Automated image/video transcoding for multiple formats/resolutions
- AI-powered image tagging and categorization
- Thumbnail generation with smart cropping

### Content Moderation Pipeline
- AI-based content screening before publication
- Profanity and spam detection
- Image content safety checking

### Translation Workflows
- Sync content to translation services and import results
- Translation memory management
- Locale-specific content validation

## Infrastructure as Code

### Terraform State Management
- Automated state backup and versioning
- Drift detection and alerting
- Plan execution automation

### Kubernetes Operations
- Automated cluster upgrades
- Resource optimization recommendations
- Backup and disaster recovery

### DNS Management
- Automated DNS record updates
- DNSSEC key rotation
- DNS performance monitoring

## Integration Opportunities

All these automation workflows can leverage the existing foundation:
- **Bun runtime** for fast execution
- **TypeScript** for type-safe development
- **GitHub Actions** for orchestration
- **Existing modules** (logger, retry, notifications) for common functionality
- **R2/S3** for artifact storage
- **Slack notifications** for alerting

Each automation could follow the same modular architecture pattern established in the backup system, with clear separation of concerns and comprehensive testing.
